<h1>Hello <%= @user.user_detail.name %>,</h1>
<p>
  Iâ€™m Norby, the robot of <%= @application %>.
</p>
<p>
  Huston, I have a problem: your subscription <%= @subscription.description %> has expired today, but at the moment you have only <%=@user.balance%> UKP in your account so I'm not able to renew it.<br/>
  Don't worry, I'll retry automatically in <%= Settings.grey_days %> and <%=@subscription.amount.tof/100%> UKP will be subtracted from your balance.<br/>
  At the moment you have <%=@user.balance%> UKP in your account so, in the meantime, please go to <%= link_to @recharge_url, @recharge_url %> to top up your account.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks again,
</p>
