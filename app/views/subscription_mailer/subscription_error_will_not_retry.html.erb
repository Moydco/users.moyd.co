<h1>Hello <%= @user.user_detail.name %>,</h1>
<p>
  Iâ€™m Norby, the robot of <%= @application %>.
</p>
<p>
  Huston, I have a big problem: your subscription <%= @subscription.description %> has expired <%= Settings.grey_days %> days ago, I tried two times to debit
  <%=@subscription.amount.tof/100%> UKP from your balance, but unsuccessfully.<br/>
  At the moment you have <%=@user.balance%> UKP in your account so is impossible to renew your subscription and the service was disabled. Please contact us if you want to re-enable your service.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks again,
</p>
